# Neural networks & Deep-learning

### Neural nets

- Ising model 2D
- Kohonen: A sefl-organizing neural net that leans input distribution (2D)
- 8 Rocks problem: Place 8 rocks on a chess board. Solved using continuous Ising model (mean field theory)
- 8 Queens problem: Place 8 Queens on a chess board. Using a continuous Ising model (mean field theory)

### Tensorflow

Basic sample code:

- XOR: Backpropagation with Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- XOR: Backpropagation with Average Cross-Entropy (ACE)
- MNist: Learn to categorize digits

More advanced:
- Facial recognition
- Sex identification (from facial recognition)
