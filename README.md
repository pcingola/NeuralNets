# Some random Neural nets stuff

- Ising model 2D
- Kohonen: A sefl-organizing neural net that leans input distribution (2D)

# Tensorflow

Basic sample code:

- XOR: Using RMS error
- XOR: Using Cross-Entropy loss function
- MNist: Learn to categorize digits

More advanced:
- Facial recognition
- Sex identification (from facial recognition)
